**EdgeChat is an open-source team chat system running on Cloudflare.** Use it to build an independent chat space for your team, project, or small community: keep discussions in groups, private matters in direct messages, and share voice messages and files whenever you need.

You do not need to maintain a permanently running server. The application and data resources are deployed in your own Cloudflare account, with GitHub Actions handling automatic deployment and updates. If your members already use Telegram, you can connect the groups on both sides and let everyone keep using the chat entry point they are familiar with.

## Live Demo

**[Open the EdgeChat live demo →](https://edgechat-demo.wcjxxgaq.workers.dev)**

Take a look at the interface before deciding whether to deploy.

The demo site reuses the production project's Vue pages, routes, state management, and real-time messaging logic. However, its API, WebSocket, file uploads, and Telegram relay are simulated in browser memory; it is not a multi-user chat room connected to a real backend.

Refresh the page or click “Reset Demo Data” in the upper-right corner to restore the initial state. Demo actions do not access the production Worker or write to D1, KV, or R2.

## Why EdgeChat

EdgeChat is for people who **want their own chat space without having to maintain a server, database, and complete runtime environment over the long term.**

| What you care about | How EdgeChat handles it |
|---|---|
| Deployment and maintenance | Built on Cloudflare Workers, with no permanently running server to maintain; supports automatic deployment through GitHub Actions |
| Members and administration | Provides independent accounts, public and private groups, direct messages, and an admin console |
| Existing Telegram groups | Uses two-way Bot bridging so members on both sides can keep using the entry point they prefer |
| Customization and extension | The source is open, so you can adapt the interface and features to your needs |

The project itself is free and open source. Cloud service costs depend on your Cloudflare plan, resource configuration, and actual usage.

## Telegram Two-Way Bridging

**You do not have to move everyone into the same application.**

Administrators can bind EdgeChat groups to Telegram groups and relay messages in both directions through a Telegram Bot: messages sent on the web can be synchronized to Telegram, and messages in the Telegram group return to EdgeChat.

This suits teams and communities that already have Telegram groups but also need an independent web chat entry point.

## Features

### 💬 Chat and Conversations

- Public groups, private groups, and one-to-one direct messages.
- Real-time messages, paginated message history, voice messages, and file sharing.
- Message replies, quote navigation, @ mentions, and reply reminders.
- Block and unblock direct-message contacts; while blocked, neither party can continue sending DMs.
- Optional scheduled hard deletion of expired messages.

### 🎨 Everyday Experience

- Liquid Glass-style interface adapted for desktop and mobile.
- Voice recording, waveform progress, and variable-speed playback.
- In-app message notifications in the web interface; browser system notifications are available in the background with user permission.
- File uploads, avatar management, and basic accessibility support.

### 🛠 Instance Administration

- Dashboard, user management, registration invitations, and site settings.
- Supports permanent bans and temporary bans configured in days, hours, or minutes; temporary bans lift automatically when they expire, without an additional scheduled task.
- Compare directly with the source repository in the browser to check whether the current deployment has updates.

### 🔌 Connections and Extensions

- Two-way Telegram group message bridging, including voice message synchronization.
- WebMCP site tools: in compatible client environments, provides login, conversation queries, message reading, sending, and related capabilities.

## Privacy and Encryption

EdgeChat uses AES-256-GCM server-side encryption at rest for **newly written message bodies and newly uploaded attachments**. Historical plaintext data remains unchanged; reads support both new and old data, and deployment or background jobs do not perform a bulk encryption backfill.

The admin console does not provide an entry point for viewing group or direct-message bodies, but administrators can still view aggregate statistics such as message counts.

> [!NOTE]
> **This is server-side encryption, not end-to-end encryption.**
> The Worker decrypts content after checking session permissions. The Cloudflare runtime and the party holding the keys must still be trusted. The absence of a message-viewing entry point in the admin console does not mean that the deployer is technically unable to access the content.
>
> When Telegram bridging is enabled, relayed messages also enter the corresponding Telegram conversation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Key Management and Rotation</strong></summary>

<br />

GitHub Actions manages the server-side encryption Worker Secrets. On the first deployment, if the target Worker has no encryption Secret, the workflow automatically generates a random 32-byte AES key, injects it as an independently versioned Secret, and records the current active key ID. Subsequent ordinary deployments only check that these Secrets exist; they do not regenerate, overwrite, or rotate them.

An existing `EDGECHAT_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING` JSON keyring in production is preserved exactly and remains supported.

To specify a key manually, create a GitHub Repository Secret named `EDGECHAT_ENCRYPTION_KEYRING`:

```json
{"activeKeyId":"v1","keys":{"v1":"BASE64_ENCODED_32_BYTE_KEY"}}
```

The first deployment adopts this value directly.

To enable automatic incremental rotation for an existing Worker, manually run `Deploy Worker` and check `rotate_encryption_key`. The workflow adds only one versioned key Secret and switches the active key ID to the new version; all old Secrets and the old JSON keyring remain unchanged. New messages use the new key, while old ciphertext continues to be decrypted with the key ID in its own envelope.

`apply_encryption_keyring` is a fallback manual override entry point. When using it, the Repository Secret must contain the complete JSON keyring. `keys` must retain every old key ID still referenced by historical ciphertext, then add the new key and update `activeKeyId`.

**Deleting an old key makes the corresponding historical ciphertext permanently unreadable.** `apply_encryption_keyring` and `rotate_encryption_key` cannot be enabled in the same run.

## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment with GitHub Actions

Using the GitHub Actions workflow included in the repository is recommended for deployment and subsequent updates.

After completing the Cloudflare authorization and repository configuration described in the documentation, you can manually run `Deploy Worker`, or trigger deployment by pushing code to the `master` or `main` branch. The workflow file is `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml`.

**[Quick Start](https://echat.azora.top/guide/getting-started.html) · [GitHub Actions Deployment Guide](https://echat.azora.top/guide/actions-deploy.html)**

### Manual Deployment and Docker

See the [deployment documentation](https://echat.azora.top/guide/getting-started.html) for local manual deployment resource preparation, configuration, and notes.

See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for Docker-related information.

### Android Client

<details>
<summary>Client, installation, and build instructions</summary>

<br />

The `capacitor/` client bundles the Vue Web UI in its APK and uses a small amount of Kotlin to integrate with the system file picker, notifications, microphone permissions, notification conversation navigation, and external links. Its package name is `com.aozorae.edgechat.web`. On first login, enter your own EdgeChat HTTPS service address; it is not tied to a fixed deployment.

- Package: download `edgechat-*.apk` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aozorae/Edgechat/releases) and verify `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- First use: enter your EdgeChat HTTPS service address, account, and password.
- Local build: prepare JDK 21 and Android SDK 36, then run `npm run build:capacitor`.
- Debug APK: `capacitor/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/capacitor-android-ci.yml` uploads `edgechat-capacitor-debug`.
- Release: push an `android-v*` tag or manually run `Android Release`, using the four `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` Secrets to build a signed APK/AAB.
- Service switching: you can change the address after signing out; switching instances automatically clears the old instance token.

Room offline database, WorkManager Outbox, and FCM are not currently included; when the app stops receiving messages, background instant notifications are not guaranteed.

The native `android/` Kotlin + Jetpack Compose client is temporarily deprecated and is no longer the default distribution. Its source, API v1 contract, and separate CI are temporarily retained.

See the [Android client documentation](https://echat.azora.top/guide/android.html) for complete details.

## Local Development

```bash
# Get the source
git clone https://github.com/aozorae/Edgechat.git
cd Edgechat

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend-only demo without deploying cloud resources first
npm run dev:demo
```

Before connecting to a real backend for development or deployment, prepare the required Cloudflare resources and configuration according to the documentation.

```bash
# Frontend development
npm run dev:frontend

# Local build
npm run build

# Manual local deployment
npm run deploy
```

<details>
<summary>Demo site build, deployment, and CI environment variables</summary>

<br />

```bash
# Build the demo site separately
npm run build:demo

# Deploy the standalone demo Worker
npm run deploy:demo
```

The demo site uses `wrangler.demo.toml` and `.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml`; the Worker is named `edgechat-demo`. GitHub Actions supports manual triggers only and reads `DEMO_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `DEMO_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; it does not change the existing production deployment workflow.

When deploying in a non-interactive environment, set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in advance.

The background update check automatically records the current GitHub repository, branch, and commit at build time. For accurate results, manual deployments should be built inside a Git repository from a clean commit that has already been pushed; the source repository must remain public so the browser can call the GitHub Compare API directly. This process does not create a scheduled task.

PowerShell example:

```powershell
$env:CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN = "your-token"
npm run deploy
```
